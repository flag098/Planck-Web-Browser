# Planck-Web-Browser
Very simple web browser - like the Planck length

The Planck Web Browser is a extremely simple, free to use mobile web browser. 
As of now, the web broswer supports one page at a time, ability to change the background color, ability to have Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, Baidu, Ask, Naver, Ecosia, AOL, Dogpile, and WolframAlpha be your main search engine, and the web broswer can be in English, Spanish, Russian, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic.

As I said before, this web broswer is extremely simple, and that means having a basic Android layout on the app.
